# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION-CODSOFT 

Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project, completed during my CodSoft internship, focuses on predicting customer churn, helping businesses identify and retain at-risk customers.

Project Overview

Using a dataset of customer demographics, account info, services used, and billing methods, we developed a machine learning model to predict churn.

Workflow

1. Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical data, and scaled features.


2. EDA: Explored patterns and correlations in churn behavior.


3. Modeling: Trained and evaluated models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost) using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.


4. Insights: Identified important factors such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure influencing churn.



Results

Our model achieved an accuracy of [XX]% with key insights into factors affecting churn, providing actionable data for customer retentionÂ strategies.
